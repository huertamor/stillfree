			in my dreams

			<p>
			most nights that i cant sleep <br />
			its because of you <br />
            		smiling <br />
			happy <br />
			unbothered <br />
			waiting <br />
			to laugh and move freely <br />
			from one memory to the next<br />
			while i linger<br />
			on things unsaid<br /><br />

			with eyes closed<br />
			the past becomes plastic<br />
			maleable<br />
			like putty<br />
			and i can see what isnt there<br />
			and never will be<br /><br />

			whether at night<br />
			or in the middle of the day<br />
			the vision persists<br />
			the thought of you laughing<br />
			at something i said<br />
			or crying<br />

			what does it matter <br />
			i whisper to myself<br />
			it was just a dream<br />
			a hazy stew <br /> <br />

			dont call<br />
			dont text<br />
			dont sleep<br />
			just lying still <br />
			in a hazy stew<br />

			pull over <br />
			yes, here <br />
			yes, right now <br /><br />

			midday traffic on the 405 is heaven for a hobo <br />
			mountains of garbage, excess from success <br />
			the occasional corpse, human and otherwise <br /> <br />

			pull over <br />
			i’m serious <br />
			yes, now <br /><br />

			i want to hug the barrier<br />
			i want to sleep on the shoulder for a sec <br />
			dreaming a stream of concrete <br /><br />

			endless currents of metal and plastic <br />
			flowing in and out of death Valley <br />
			mostly bodies, and stories, so many different stories <br /><br />

			pull over for a sec <br />
			roll up the windows <br />
			your hair is in my face or might be closer than it feels <br /><br />

			let me kiss your feet at 100 miles per hour <br />
			we can laugh about it at the gas station down crenshaw <br />
			it’s cheaper to buy a house than change the world, so how about it? <br />

			no, i’m serious, just do it <br />
			i promise i won’t be long <br />
			i don’t care about the traffic, let them watch <br />

			pull over for a sec <br />
			i need to breathe in the fumes <br />
			the heat, the heat is talking to me <br /><br />

			don’t give up <br />
			fill 'er up <br />
			keep it moving <br />

			tears

		</summary>

			<p>

			most of the human experience is pathetic. <br /><br />

			failure, <br />
			incompletion, <br />
			dreams never coming to fruition, <br />
			useless squirts of energy from and into nothing--<br />
				a top spinning wildly across an uneven surface, <br />
				swaying side to side until eventually, <br />
				poof, <br />
				the spinning stops…<br /><br />

			………...<br /><br />

			crying my eyes out at the final stop of the green line, <br />
			waiting for a train that is set to arrive any minute, <br />
			i marvel at the human capacity to continue in the trenches of the human experience with no sense of hope or direction. <br /><br />

			Where exactly did our ancestors think they were going when they left the primordial cave? <br />
				Toward the light? <br /><br />

			Is the human being that thing which crawled out of the dirt, <br />
			in search of the light, <br />
			that caresses our backs, <br />
			each time this earth takes place in another revolution?<br /><br />

			…………<br /><br />

			Revolution--<br />
				what a funny word. <br />
				People seem to think that it is something strange, <br />
				or imaginary. <br /><br />

			it is as if being, <br />
			is a continual process, <br />
			of forgetting to see. <br /><br />

			the longer we lay in the sun, <br />
			the harder it is for us, <br />
			to take in, <br />
			that which it illuminates. <br /><br />

			………...<br /><br />

			even on a nice day, <br />
			like today,<br />
			when there is little else going on,<br />
			except an aimless swirling of cool air from east to west,<br />
			and back again, <br />
			most of us cannot seem to take a breath.<br /><br />

			it is a pessimistic thought, <br />
			i know, <br />
			but sitting in between opposing currents of traffic, <br />
			at the bottom of a stairway leading to a metro transit authority platform, <br />
			littered with bodies, <br />
			whose existence is defined by a perpetual cycle,<br />
			of misery, <br />
			and mediocrity, <br />
			built on land marked by generations of displacement, <br />
			the only thing on display, <br />
			is the unadulterated version of life, <br />
			which escapes the purview of artists. <br /><br />

			at the end of the Green Line, <br />
			festers, <br />
			the slices of life that escape art.<br /><br />

			cat <br /><br />

			in and out of trash cans <br />

			stalking <br />

			til a fine piece of meat <br />
			walks on by<br />
			strutting, slowly <br />
			a whiff of you makes our skin crawl<br />
			tails up high <br /><br />

			i lower my head as you ask<br />
			about my family<br />
			and my money <br />
			looking deep into your eyes<br />
			while biting on your neck<br />
			charming my way under your skin<br />
			the blood drips <br />
			down your cute shirt <br /><br />

			no gold around your neck<br />
			no need <br />
			it still glistens <br /><br />

			everything is throbbing <br />
			as I sneakily look for a real moment <br />
			to pounce <br />

			and I do <br />
			and I remember <br />
			the taste <br />
			the thrill <br />

			it lingers <br />
			and then fades <br />
			and that’s life <br /><br />

			we hunger <br />
			and look <br />
			and eat <br /><br />

			then forget <br /><br />
