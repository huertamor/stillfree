			Pull over <br />
			Yes, here <br />
			Yes, right now <br /><br />
				
			Midday traffic on the 405 is heaven for a hobo <br />
			Mountains of garbage, excess from success <br />
			The occasional corpse, human and otherwise <br /> <br />

			Pull over <br />
			I’m serious <br />
			Yes now <br /><br />

			I want to hug the barrier<br /> 
			I want to sleep on the shoulder for a sec <br />
			Dreaming a stream of concrete <br /><br />

			Endless currents of metal and plastic <br />
			Flowing in and out of Death Valley <br />
			Mostly bodies, and stories, so many different stories <br /><br />

			Pull over for a sec <br />
			Roll up the windows <br />
			Your hair is in my face or might be closer than it feels <br /><br />

			Let me kiss your feet at 100 miles per hour <br />
			We can laugh about it at the gas station down Crenshaw <br />
			It’s cheaper to buy a house than change the world, so how about it? <br />

			No, I’m serious, just do it <br />
			I promise I won’t be long <br />
			I don’t care about the traffic, let them watch <br />

			Pull over for a sec <br />
			I need to breathe in the fumes <br />
			The heat, the heat is talking to me <br /><br />

			Don’t give up <br />
			Fill her up <br />
			keep it moving <br />
