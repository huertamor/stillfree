			the vision persists<br />
			the thought of you laughing<br />
			at something i said<br />
			or crying<br />

			what does it matter <br />
			i whisper to myself<br />
			it was just a dream<br />
			a hazy stew <br /> <br />

			dont call<br />

			dont sleep<br />

			tears

		</summary>

			<p>

			most of the human experience is pathetic. <br /><br />

			failure, <br />
			incompletion, <br />
			dreams never coming to fruition, <br />
			useless squirts of energy from and into nothing--<br />
				a top spinning wildly across an uneven surface, <br />
				swaying side to side until eventually, <br />
				poof, <br />
				the spinning stops…<br /><br />

			………...<br /><br />

			crying my eyes out at the final stop of the green line, <br />
			waiting for a train that is set to arrive any minute, <br />
			i marvel at the human capacity to continue in the trenches of the human experience with no sense of hope or direction. <br /><br />

			Where exactly did our ancestors think they were going when they left the primordial cave? <br />
				Toward the light? <br /><br />

			Is the human being that thing which crawled out of the dirt, <br />
			in search of the light, <br />
			that caresses our backs, <br />
			each time this earth takes place in another revolution?<br /><br />

			…………<br /><br />

			Revolution--<br />
				what a funny word. <br />
				People seem to think that it is something strange, <br />
				or imaginary. <br /><br />

			it is as if being, <br />
			is a continual process, <br />
			of forgetting to see. <br /><br />

			the longer we lay in the sun, <br />
			the harder it is for us, <br />
			to take in, <br />
			that which it illuminates. <br /><br />

			………...<br /><br />

			even on a nice day, <br />
			like today,<br />
			when there is little else going on,<br />
			except an aimless swirling of cool air from east to west,<br />
			and back again, <br />
			most of us cannot seem to take a breath.<br /><br />

			it is a pessimistic thought, <br />
			i know, <br />
			but sitting in between opposing currents of traffic, <br />
			at the bottom of a stairway leading to a metro transit authority platform, <br />
			littered with bodies, <br />
			whose existence is defined by a perpetual cycle,<br />
			of misery, <br />
			and mediocrity, <br />
			built on land marked by generations of displacement, <br />
			the only thing on display, <br />
			is the unadulterated version of life, <br />
			which escapes the purview of artists. <br /><br />

			at the end of the Green Line, <br />
			festers, <br />
			the slices of life that escape art.<br /><br />

		Light around the edges<br />
		Your constellation <br />
		And mine<br />
		Stargazing and together<br />
		Its cold at night<br />

		A pack of coyotes<br />
		Struggling for control<br />
		Howling at the moon<br />
		We howl too<br /><br />

		The neighbors are either<br />
		Drunk<br />
		Or fucking<br />
		They aren’t noisy<br />
		Or nosy<br />
		Like us<br /><br />

		Every dry patch<br />
		Of land<br />
		In the desert<br />
		Could be ours<br /><br />

		A hare<br />
		Some crystal shrooms<br />
		A kaleidoscope desert<br />
		Prehistoric birds<br />
		Dogs <br />
		So many dogs<br />
		And us<br />
		Running in and out<br />
		Or sitting<br />
		Still<br />
		Watching<br />
		Like the sheriff<br />
		Or the old man<br />
		At the bar<br />
		That likes the blues<br />
		And says I’m sorry<br /><br />

		Old us<br />
		On a sunny day<br />

		Down the trail<br />
		In the hills<br />
		Tucked away<br />
		Like a secret<br />
		Worth keeping<br />
